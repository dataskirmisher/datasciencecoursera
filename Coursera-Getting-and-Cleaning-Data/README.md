This file describes how run_analysis.R script works.

* First, make sure the folder "data" and the run_analysis.R script are both in the current working directory.
	* As you will notice, I brought  all needed files to upper level to facilitate reading.
* Than, use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio.
* Third, two files will be generated in the current working directory:
	* tidy_data.txt (7,95 MB )
	* means_data.txt (219 KB)
